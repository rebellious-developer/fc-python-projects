Renames all files in a directory based on a specified pattern.

Notes:
- Often, we have a large number of files in a directory with names that do not follow a specific pattern or are not easy to understand. Renaming each file manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. To solve this problem, we need a program that can rename a large number of files in bulk, based on a specified pattern.
- Can you develop a Python program that takes a directory path and a pattern as input, and renames all the files in the directory that match the pattern to a new name that follows the specified pattern?

Requirements:
- TODO
